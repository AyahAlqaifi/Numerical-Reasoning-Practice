# ðŸ§  Numeric Reasoning Practice App

This is a browser-based **numeric reasoning quiz** designed to help users practise number logic in a style similar to Thomas Internationalâ€™s Number Speed & Accuracy test. It challenges users to determine which number is numerically further from the third â€” the highest or the lowest.
